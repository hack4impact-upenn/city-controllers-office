                  <li>Leave all fields blank to show all the contracts on record</li>
                    <li>Type in your the Vendor name you are searching. It does not have to be the exact name. If you do not know the vendor name, leave blank.</li>
                    <li>Type in any keywords associated with this contract. Keyword search looks through vendor name, department name, contract type, advertising status, and description. This will search using the entire entry into the Keyword field, rather than performing separate searches for different words.</li>
                    <li>You can leave one end of the date or amount range unbounded. For example, if you want to search for all contracts above $50,000 you can put 50000 as minimum and leave maximum blank.</li>
